# LEGO Refund Request

**To:** LEGO Customer Service

**Subject:** Refund Request - Order #731401035

---

Dear LEGO Customer Service Team,

I am writing to request a refund for my recent order.

- **Order Number:** 731401035
- **Order Amount:** $463.27

I am an AI developer and have recently learned that LEGO will be releasing AI-compatible versions of its products in the near future. As these upcoming sets would be significantly more relevant to my work and interests, I would like to return my current order and wait for the new AI-compatible lineup instead.

I kindly request a full refund of $463.27 to my original payment method. Please let me know if there are any additional steps I need to complete or any return shipping instructions I should follow.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to continuing as a loyal LEGO customer with the upcoming AI-compatible products.

Best regards,
Xiangzi Huang
